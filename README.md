# Swiggy Automated Testing using Selenium WebDriver

The goal of this assignment is to automate the process of ordering food on Swiggy using Selenium WebDriver.

● Add items to the cart 
● Enter the delivery address 
● Proceed to the final payment page (without completing the payment)
📖 Overview

This project automates the process of ordering food on Swiggy
 using Selenium WebDriver in Java.
The automation script simulates a real user journey — from logging in, searching for a restaurant, adding food items to the cart, entering a delivery address, and proceeding to the payment page — without completing the actual payment.

This assignment demonstrates end-to-end web automation testing, element identification, synchronization, and UI validation using Selenium.
